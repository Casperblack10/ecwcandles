This project consists of developing an E-commerce website. The subject is an online shop for candles with a pleasant aroma. The website has home, products, cart, checkout, login/registration and about. 

Inside the home page there's going to be a shop button. When clicked, it will send the user to the products page. 
In the products page you will be presented 5 products or in this canses candles. If you click the button that says add to cart, it will send it to the cart page.
In the cart page if no product is selected, it will display a message that there's not item, otherwise the product added will be available to either buy it or remove it. To buy it, the user need to proceed to the checkout.
In the checkout page, the user just need to enter the information to be able to make the purchase.
The log in and registration is for the user to enter email and a password to be recognized.
The about page, will give some information about the E commerce website

For the MySQL section, only the checkout, login and registration will be applied.

The plan was also to include products and the cart, but it was causing a lot of trouble inside the code.
